ABSTRACT
Objectives To compare the elicited exercise 
responses at ventilatory thresholds (VTs: VT1 and 
VT2) identified by cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
(CPET) in patients with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) with the guideline- directed exercise intensity 
domains; to propose equations to predict heart 
rate (HR) at VTs; and to compare the accuracy of 
prescription methods.
Methods A cross- sectional study was performed with 972 
maximal treadmill CPET on patients with CVD. First, VTs were 
identified and compared with guideline- directed exercise 
intensity domains. Second, multivariate linear regression 
analyses were performed to generate prediction equations for 
HR at VTs. Finally, the accuracy of prescription methods was 
assessed by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
Results Significant dispersions of individual 
responses were found for VTs, with the same relative 
intensity of exercise corresponding to different 
guideline- directed exercise intensity domains. A 
mathematical error inherent to methods based on 
percentages of peak effort was identified, which may 
help to explain the dispersions. Tailored multivariable 
equations yielded r
2
 of 0.726 for VT1 and 0.901 for 
VT2. MAPE for the novel VT1 equation was 6.0%, 
lower than that for guideline- based prescription 
methods (9.5 to 23.8%). MAPE for the novel VT2 
equation was 4.3%, lower than guideline- based 
methods (5.8%–19.3%).
Conclusion The guideline- based exercise intensity 
domains for cardiovascular rehabilitation revealed 
inconsistencies and heterogeneity, which limits the 
currently used methods. New multivariable equations 
for patients with CVD were developed and demonstrated 
better accuracy, indicating that this methodology may be a 
valid alternative when CPET is unavailable.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
 ⇒Exercise intensity prescription guided by cardio-
pulmonary  exercise  testing  (CPET)  is  the  gold-  
standard method.
 ⇒Guideline-  based  exercise  intensity  domains  for  
cardiovascular  rehabilitation  revealed  marked  
inconsistencies    and    heterogeneity,    limiting    
the   heart   rate   ‘range-   based’   current   meth-
ods  employed,  commonly  used  when  CPET  is  
unavailable.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
 ⇒A  mathematical  error  is  inherent  to  methods  
based  on  simple  percentages  of  peak  effort,  
which  is  minimised  using  multivariable  equa-
tions  derived  from  parameters  that  can  be  ob-
tained in an ergometry test.
 ⇒The  novel  equations  tailored  for  patients  with  
cardiovascular  diseases  (CVDs)  demonstrated  
superior  accuracy  (mean  absolute  percentage  
error  of  6.0%  for  the  first  ventilatory  threshold  
and 4.3% for the second ventilatory threshold), 
indicating  that  these  equations  may  be  a  valid  
alternative when CPET is unavailable.
HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, 
PRACTICE OR POLICY
 ⇒This study offers a new clinical perspective when 
CPET is not available. We recommend using the 
multivariable equations tailored to patients with 
CVD  rather  than  the  classic  ‘range-  based’  pre-
scription that uses a percentage of peak effort. 
The equations presented in this study can be an 
interesting  alternative,  as  demonstrated  by  the  
high r² values and the better forecasting accura-
cy compared with other indirect methods.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular   rehabilitation   (CR)   for   patients   with   
cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a consensus among inter-
national  guidelines,
1–5
  considering  the  reductions  in  
morbidity and mortality rates.
5–10
 Hence, properly deter-
mining  the  exercise  intensity  prescription  for  patients  
with CVD is a cornerstone of an efficient and safe CR.
11 12
 
Ideally, exercise intensity prescription is established by an 
individualised functional capacity assessment, and cardio-
pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold- standard 
method.
2  3  11  13  14
  Indeed,  evidence  has  demonstrated  
that  patients  with  CVD  have  heterogeneous  responses  
to  incremental  exercise,  with  differences  in  the  first  
and   second   ventilatory   thresholds   (VT1   and   VT2)   
when expressed in oxygen uptake (VO
2
) and heart rate 
(HR).
3  15
  In  addition,  studies  have  documented  great  
variability  in  individual  metabolic  responses  when  exer-
cise intensity is performed in relation to percentages of 
peak effort.
16–18
 This occurs because prescriptions based 
on peak exercise percentages assume all participants will 
experience  similar  physiological  responses  at  the  same  
relative intensity, which is not necessarily true.
18 19
 Thus, 
a  ‘threshold-  based’  prescription  rather  than  a  ‘range-  
based’ approach is recommended to improve the benefits 
of CR.
3 11 14
When   CPET   is   unavailable,   CR   guidelines   recom-
mend an aerobic exercise prescription based on indices 
of peak effort, including percentages of peak workload, 
peak  HR  (%HR
peak
)  or  HR  reserve  (%HRR)  according  
to  responses  during  an  ergometry  test.  However,  recent  
evidence  has  shown  the  need  to  carefully  revise  these  
methods currently applied in CR due to internal incon-
sistencies and disagreements.
11 16 17
 Hansen et al
16
 studied 
272 patients with CVD assessed by CPET on a cycle ergom-
eter. They revealed that the same relative level of exercise 
elicited  different  intensity  domains,  with  a  considerable  
interindividual variation ranging from low to hard inten-
sity. Pymer et al
17
 found similar results in a study involving 
112  patients,  in  which  inaccuracy  was  found  in  many  
patients  when  HR  corresponding  to  VT1  was  compared  
with HR- based exercise prescription.
Considering  these  significant  discrepancies  in  indi-
vidual  responses  to  effort  intensity  in  the  ‘range-  based  
methods’ recommended by CR guidelines,
2 11 20
 and the 
lack  of  consistent  guidance  regarding  exercise  prescrip-
tions for patients with CVD, it is essential to explore this 
subject  more  deeply,  compare  different  international  
recommendations, seek solutions to the observed incon-
sistencies and develop new methods.
Thus,  our  study  aimed  to  compare  elicited  exercise  
responses at VT1 and VT2 (expressed as %HR
peak
, %HRR 
and  percentage  of  peak  VO
2
  (%VO
2peak
))  to  Brazilian‚
2
 
European
11
   and   American
20
   guideline-   based   exercise   
intensity  domains  for  CR.  A  further  aim  was  to  propose  
equations to improve HR- based prescription parameters 
tailored  to  patients  with  CVD  using  variables  available  
in  an  ergometry  test.  We  also  compared  the  accuracy  
of   guideline-   based   prescriptions'   moderate   intensity   
domains according to %HR
peak
 and the novel equations.
METHODS
Population and design
A  single-  centre  retrospective  cross-  sectional  study  was  
conducted  involving  the  records  of  patients  with  CVD  
assessed   by   CPET   in   the   Brazilian   Midwest   region   
between  January  2011  and  December  2021.  Patients  
were  primarily  referred  to  CPET  for  cardiovascular  risk  
stratification  and  exercise  prescription.  The  tests  were  
supervised  and  interpreted  according  to  international  
recommendations.
14 20–22
The inclusion criteria were treadmill CPETs performed 
by patients with CVD aged ≥20 years and the absence of 
pulmonary, neurological or severe orthopaedic diseases. 
The  exclusion  criteria  were  atrial  fibrillation,  a  pace-
maker  or  implantable  cardioverter-  defibrillator  without  
sinus rhythm during exercise, a non- identified VT2 and 
respiratory exchange ratio (RER)<1.10 at peak effort.
Patient and public involvement
As  data  were  collected  retrospectively,  there  was  no  
patient or public involvement in the study.
Assessments
The  subjects  underwent  a  clinical  assessment  with  the  
acquisition  of  demographic  and  anthropometric  vari-
ables,   clinical   information   about   cardiovascular   risk   
factors, previous diseases and medication use.
The tests were conducted without withdrawing cardio-
vascular medication and were performed on a treadmill 
(Centurium  200,  Micromed,  Brazil)  using  breath-  by-  
breath  gas  analysis  (Cortex  Metalyser  3B,  Germany).  
Symptom- limited maximal exercise testing was performed 
with  an  individualised  adjusted  ‘ramp  protocol’.  Tread-
mill speed started at 1.5–3 km/hour without inclination. 
The load increase rate was linear and adjusted according 
to  age,  sex  and  disease  severity,  with  a  steeper  speed  
increase  in  males  and  younger  subjects,  while  a  steeper  
grade  increase  was  applied  in  older  subjects.  This  load  
adjustment  in  the  ramp  protocol  was  individualised  to  
yield  a  fatigue-  limited  exercise  test  with  an  expected  
duration of 8–12 min.
21 22
Variables  from  CPET  were  analysed,  converting  raw  
data  to  a  9-  breath  moving  average.  Peak  VO
2
  (VO
2peak
) 
was the highest 30 s averaged sample obtained from the 
final  test  minute.  At  the  same  time  frame,  the  highest  
value  of  RER  and  HR  at  peak  effort  was  considered.  
Resting HR (HRrest) was obtained by ECG in the seated 
position before the beginning of CPET and after a total 
rest time greater than 5 min, considering the preparation 
for the exam.
20
 Predicted HR
peak
 was calculated using the 
Tanaka  equation
23
,  and  predicted  VO
2peak
  was  based  on  
Brazilian reference values
24
 .
VTs  were  used  to  define  the  gold-  standard  exercise  
intensity  domains.  VT1  marks  the  limit  between  light  
to moderate exercise, and VT2 marks the limit between

moderate  to  high-  intensity  effort.

  Individual  deter-
mination  of  VT1  and  VT2  was  based  on  the  analysis  of  
the  exercise  ventilation  (VE),  VO
2
  and  carbon  dioxide  
production   (VCO
2
)   over   time,   oxygen   and   carbon   
dioxide  ventilatory  equivalent  (VE/VO
2
  and  VE/CO
2
) 
over  time  and  end-  tidal  partial  pressure  for  oxygen  and  
carbon dioxide (PETO
2
 and PETCO
2
) over time
14
 .
VT1  was  defined  using  the  V-  slope  method  (VCO
2
 
vs VO
2
 plot) and was double- checked by establishing 
the  nadir  of  VE/VO
2
  and  PETO
2
  before  rising
14
  in  
the graphs over time. VT2 was defined using the VE 
vs  VCO
2
  plot  at  the  point  where  VE  increases  out  
of  proportion  to  VCO
2
.  This  threshold  was  double-  
checked by establishing the nadir of VE/VCO
2
 before 
rising and the highest PETCO
2
 before falling.
14
 VO
2
 
and HR were determined at VT1 and VT2 to calculate 
%VO
2peak
, %HR
peak
 and %HRR.
Intensity domains according to international guidelines
Obtained  HR  and  VO
2
  at  VT1  and  VT2  were  individ-
ually  categorised  in  intensity  domains  according  to  
CR  guidelines
2  11  20
  based  on  %VO
2peak
,  %HR
peak
  and  
%HRR  (figure  1).  These  three  methods  report  exer-
cise  intensity  domains  in  European  and  American  
guidelines, whereas Brazilian recommendations focus 
only on HR methods.
Multivariable equations to predict HR at VTs
Predictors  were  selected  considering  variables  avail-
able in an ergometry test. This approach was chosen to 
create useful equations to predict HR at VT1 and VT2 
when  CPET  cannot  be  performed.  Thus,  peak  meta-
bolic  equivalent  (MET
peak
)  was  calculated  according  
to  peak  treadmill  speed  and  inclination
25
  and  used  
as  a  predictor  in  the  regression  analysis  rather  than  
measured  VO
2peak
.  The  other  predictors  tested  were  
age,  sex,  HR
peak
,  HR
rest
,  HRR,  beta-  blocker  use  and  
beta- blockers relative dose (percentual of daily use to 
the maximal recommended dose).
26
Accuracy of prescription methods
To  evaluate  the  accuracy  of  the  prescription  methods,  
HR values at VT1 and VT2 were compared with estimated 
values  of  each  guideline-  directed  recommendation  for  
moderate intensity domains according to %HR
peak
 using 
measured and predicted HR
peak.
23
 This approach was also 
used for the equations developed in the study.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as median and IQR or absolute and 
relative  frequencies.  Normality  was  assessed  using  the  
Kolmogorov-  Smirnov  test.  Correlations  between  CPET  
variables   were   calculated   using   Spearman’s   correla-
tion  test  since  the  data  had  a  non-  normal  distribution.  
Considering  variables  significantly  correlated  with  HR  
at  VT1  and  VT2,  we  performed  linear  regressions  with  
HR
peak
  and  multilinear  regressions  with  the  stepwise  
forward  method.  We  selected  the  equation  with  the  
highest adjusted r
2
 value. Predictors without the ability to 
increase  r
2
  by  at  least  0.01  were  removed  from  the  final  
equation.
Accuracy  analysis  was  performed  by  calculating  the  
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE; mean absolute 
difference  of  measured  minus  estimated  values  divided  
by measured values). Lower MAPE values indicate a lower 
error and greater forecasting accuracy of a model. Statis-
tical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V.9 
(GraphPad  Software,  San  Diego,  California,  USA)  or  
IBM- SPSS V.28.0 for Windows. All tests with a significance 
of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Sample and subject characteristics
A total of 1465 CPETs were considered for eligibility, and 
972 examinations were included (figure 2). The patients 
were  mainly  males  (80.8%)  with  a  median  age  of  58  
(IQR: 50–66). Most patients had coronary artery disease 
(81.4%),  and  26.6%  had  heart  failure  with  a  reduced  
ejection fraction (table 1). Median VO
2peak
 was 22.1 mL/
kg/min (IQR: 17.1–27.4), corresponding to 70.7% of the 
predicted value (IQR: 58.8–83.4) (table 2).
VT1 and VT2 in relation to guideline-based exercise intensity 
domains
VT1   was   determined   at   58.4%   (IQR:   51.9–64.6)   of   
%VO
2peak
, 68.8% (IQR: 63.8–74.7) of %HR
peak
 and 39.0% 
(IQR: 32.9–45.8) of %HRR (table 2). For most patients, 
this  response  corresponded  to  moderate  intensity  exer-
cise  based  on  %VO
2peak
  according  to  European  and  
American  guidelines  (91.4%  and  67.3%,  respectively).  
Regarding  responses  related  to  %HR
peak
,  most  patients  
were performing low- intensity exercise according to the 
Brazilian  guidelines  (55.5%)  and  moderate  intensity  
according to European and American guidelines (73.1% 
and 57.4%, respectively). The responses of most patients 
corresponded to the low- intensity domain for %HRR in 
all three sets of guidelines (figure 1).
VT2  was  determined  at  89.0%  (IQR:  85.0–92.6)  of  
%VO
2peak
, 89.1% (IQR: 85.8–92.2) of %HR
peak
 and 78.0% 
(IQR: 71.6–84.5) of %HRR (table 2). For most patients, 
these  responses  corresponded  to  very  high  intensity  for  
%VO
2peak
 according to the European guidelines (75.2% 
of individual responses) and high intensity according to 
the American guidelines (62.8%). Considering %HR
peak
, 
most    individual    responses    corresponded    to    high-    
intensity  domains  as  stated  in  the  Brazilian,  European  
and  American  guidelines  (78.3%,  55.5%  and  93.3%,  
respectively).  Lastly,  individual  responses  corresponded  
to  the  moderate  intensity  domain  for  %HRR  according  
to  the  Brazilian  guidelines  (57.2%)  and  high  intensity  
according to European and American guidelines (57.4% 
and 89.0%, respectively) (figure 1).
HR predictive equations in VTs
HR    at    VT1    was    strongly    correlated    with    HR
peak
 
(rho=0.764),  with  the  linear  regression  revealing  a  r
2
  of  
0.593 (figure 3A). The following equation represents this 
correlation:
 
HRatVT1=(0.4707×HR
peak
)+30.62
  
(1)
Also, the linear regression of %HRpeak at VT1 versus 
HR
peak
(figure 3B) revealed that higher values of %HR
peak
 
at VT1 were associated with lower values of HR
peak
.

HR at VT2 strongly correlated with HR
peak
 (rho=0.941), 
with   the   linear   regression   revealing   a   r
2
   of   0.890   
(figure  3C).  Less  variability  in  %HR
peak
  at  VT2  when  
analysed according to HR
peak
 (figure 3D). The following 
equation represents this correlation:
 
HRatVT2=(0.8544×HR
peak
)+4.397
  
(2)
Nearly  all  correlations  between  CPET  variables  and  
HR at VT1 and VT2 were significant. Thus, multivariable 
linear  regression  with  predictors  available  in  an  ergom-
etry test was used to estimate HR at VT1 and VT2, which 
yielded the following novel equations tailored to patients 
with CVD with relevant r² values:
 
HR at VT1 = 3.453+(0.887×HR

Of note, beta- blockers use, age and sex were imputed 
as  predictors  in  the  model  construction;  however,  they  
did  not  reveal  significant  influences  and  were  removed  
from the equations.
Accuracy of prescription methods
Forecasting  accuracy  was  assessed  using  MAPE  calcula-
tions  (figure  4).  MAPE  of  the  novel  VT1  equation  was  
6.0%,  lower  than  values  calculated  using  the  guideline-  
based   prescription   methods   considering   measured   
HR
peak
   (9.5%–20.0%)   or   predicted   HR
peak
   (11.4%–
23.8%).   MAPE   was   even   lower   for   the   novel   VT2   
equation (4.3%), which was also lower than values deter-
mined using the guideline- based methods (5.8%–16.4% 
for  measured  HR
peak
  and  13.7%–19.3%  for  predicted  
HR
peak
).

DISCUSSION
This  study  reported  results  from  a  large  sample  of  CR  
patients, in which we found that different guideline- based 
exercise intensity domains were elicited for the same rela-
tive level of exercise, whether at VT1 or VT2 (figure 1). 
Considering  Brazilian,  European  and  American  guide-
lines, the results corresponded to low to moderate exercise 
intensity domains for VT1 and to moderate to very high- 
intensity  exercise  domains  for  VT2.  The  results  showed  
that the relations between %HRpeak at VTs and HRpeak 
are  not  constant  (figure  3),  especially  for  VT1,  which  
mathematically limits the applicability of the prescription 
methods based on a percentage of peak effort variables. 
We also offer greater insight into improving CR exercise 
prescription when CPET is unavailable by providing VT1 
and  VT2  equations  tailored  to  patients  with  CVD  using  
variables  assessed  during  an  ergometry  test.  Moreover,  
MAPE  analyses  revealed  that  the  novel  equations  have  
greater  accuracy  than  other  methods  generally  used  in  
CR  to  prescribe  the  exercise  intensity  targets  based  on  
%HR
peak
,  indicating  that  our  proposal  is  the  closest  to  
metabolic thresholds of CPET (figure 4).
VT1 and VT2 in relation to guideline-based exercise intensity 
domains
The correspondence of different exercise intensity param-
eters has been studied. Considerable variation is found in 
recommendation  targets  for  prescription,
13  16  27–30
  since  
the same relative %HR
peak
, %HRR and/or %VO
2peak
 elic-
ited different guideline- based exercise intensity domains 
(which  could  be  considered  low  to  moderate  inten-
sity  for  VT1  and  moderate  to  high  intensity  for  VT2).  
Consequently,  an  important  percentage  of  subjects  will  
be  trained  below  VT1  or  above  VT2  when  HR-  based  
methods  are  used,  as  demonstrated  by  the  high  disper-
sion  found  in  the  individual  responses  of  the  patients  
(figure  1).  Hansen  et  al
16
  also  found  considerable  vari-
ation  in  guideline-  based  exercise  intensity  domains  at  
the same relative level of exercise, and Díaz- Buschmann 
et  al
13
  pointed  out  the  substantial  interpatient  variance

among patients with CVD about HR- based prescription. 
These  findings  could  partially  be  explained  by  the  non-  
linearity  and  high  variability  of  the  relation  between  
VO

  and  workload  in  patients  with  CVD,
31  32
  chrono-

 Addition-
ally,  Iannetta  et  al
34
  recently  reported  that  the  intensity  
of  exercise  training  during  CR  predicts  the  increase  of  
MET  peak,  highlighting  that  the  heterogeneity  in  the  
metabolic stimulus of each exercise session can generate 
individual variation in training adaptations.
34–36
Novel equations for patients with CVD
This  study  revealed  a  simple  but  crucial  mathematic  
limitation  inherent  to  the  method  for  seeking  a  fixed  
percentage  of  peak  parameters  for  prescribing  exercise  
intensity.  For  example,  if  we  consider  69%  of  HR
peak
  as  
the lower limit of exercise prescription (value for HR at 
VT1 in our data), we will assume that the equation follows 
a  linear  equation  (Y=A*X  +B),  in  which  Y=HR  at  VT1,  
A=0.69, X=HR
peak
 and B=0 (HR at VT1=0.69 * HR
peak
+0). 
Thus,  the  mathematical  concept  suggests  that  the  rela-
tion between HR at VT1 and HR
peak
 (or Y/X) is constant 
when plotted against HR
peak
 (or X). In other words, when 
using the %HR
peak
 method, we assume that intercept (B) 
equals  zero  without  considering  any  correction  for  the  
data dispersion.
However, when we analyse the plotted curve of our data 
(figure  3A),  we  observe  that  the  intercept  (B)  is  30.62,  
strongly  different  from  zero.  Moreover,  the  coefficient  
(A) is 0.4707, which is also very different from the value 
considered for moderate- intensity exercise in the guide-
lines  (Brazilian:  0.70;  European:  0.55;  American:  0.64).  
We also noticed a significant association between higher 
values  of  %HR
peak
  at  VT1  and  lower  HRpeak  values  
(figure  3B).  Regarding  VT2,  our  intercept  (B)  is  much  
more like previously assumed values (4.397 vs 0), and the 
same is true for the coefficient (A) (0.8544 vs Brazilian: 
0.85; European: 0.7; American: 0.76).
Thus,   applying   this   simple   math   problem   to   the   
real  world,  we  can  see  that  the  widely  used  method  of  
prescribing   exercise   intensity   according   to   percent-
ages  of  HR
peak
  has  an  important  limitation.  The  greater  
observed  error  can  be  related  to  the  method  itself  and  
not the percentage values, as we cannot assume that the 
intercept  of  the  equation  is  zero,  especially  concerning  
VT1, which is considered the lower limit for a moderate- 
intensity exercise prescription.
Accuracy of prescription methods
Another important contribution of this study is the accu-
racy  approach  by  MAPE,  in  which  lower  values  indicate  
greater forecasting accuracy of a model. MAPE of the VT1 
equation was 6.0%, lower than guideline- based prescrip-
tion  methods  (9.5%–23.8%).  Moreover,  the  MAPE  for  
the  VT2  equation  was  4.3%,  which  was  also  lower  than  
guideline-  based  methods  (5.8%–19.3%).  These  results  
suggested  that  the  novel  equations  can  be  used  as  an  
alternative  for  patients  with  CVD,  defining  an  intensity  
closer  to  the  parameter  determined  by  the  CPET.  The  
approach  by  MAPE  was  recently  also  used  in  a  study  
comparing the accuracy of different predictive equations

 The reported MAPE for VT1 estimation 
ranged from 11.3 to 16.5% in patients with heart failure.
Clinical implications
Similarly  to  others,
13  16  17
  our  study  has  demonstrated  
that  currently  employed  methods  using  percentages  of  
peak  exercise  (‘range-  based’  approach)  can  be  inac-
curate  for  exercise  intensity  prescription,  which  may  
influence  clinical  outcomes.  Hence,  the  HR  predictive  
equations  proposed  in  this  study,  primarily  developed  
for VTs identification and using parameters available on 
the  ergometry  test,  recognised  as  a  minimum  standard,  
demonstrated  higher  r
2
  and  a  lower  error  measured  by  
MAPE than previously adopted indirect methods.
Thus, this new approach has great clinical applicability 
and may be a useful alternative when only an ergometry 
test is available, providing an indirect prescription closer 
to  VTs  of  the  CPET,  which  remains  the  gold-  standard  
method.
Limitations
First,  although  including  a  large  sample,  the  data  were  
provided  from  a  single  centre.  However,  our  sample  is  
from  Brasilia  (the  capital  of  Brazil).  It  may  constitute  
casual  pooled  data  from  different  Brazilian  regions  as  
the area received intense migration in the mid- 1960s due 
to the relocation of the capital, as previously reported.
24
 
External  validity  in  other  population  samples  remains  
to  be  tested  to  assure  international  applicability.  Lastly,  
our study only included data from CPET performed on a 
treadmill; thus, our equations may not apply to exercise 
tests obtained from cycle ergometers.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of guideline- based exercise intensity domains 
for CR revealed inconsistencies and heterogeneity among 
current    international    guidelines    recommendations,    
which limits usually used methods since the dispersion of 
individual data is considerable. Our results demonstrated 
that prescribing exercise intensity according to percent-
ages of HR
peak
 has an important mathematical limitation 
related  to  the  method  itself.  Novel  equations  tailored  
to  patients  with  CVD  were  developed,  which  revealed  
greater accuracy than other indirect methods, indicating 
that  this  methodology  may  be  a  valid  alternative  when  
CPET is unavailable.
